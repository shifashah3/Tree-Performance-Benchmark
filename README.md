This program is a performance benchmarking tool that evaluates three different types of binary search trees: AVL Tree, Scapegoat Tree, and Red-Black Tree. The benchmarking focuses on three core operations—insertion, search, and deletion—to assess and compare the efficiency of each tree type. 
The efficiency is tested on three datasets of different sizes—2000 words, 5000 words and 20000 words.

-Insertion: The program reads a series of words from an input text file and inserts them into each of the three tree structures. It measures and reports the time taken for each tree to complete the insertion process. This provides an understanding of how quickly each tree can handle large volumes of data.

-Search: After insertion, the program prompts the user to input a word for searching. It then searches for this word in all three trees and records the time taken for each search operation. This helps evaluate how fast each tree can locate a given element.

-Deletion: The user is also prompted to enter a word for deletion. The program removes the specified word from each tree and measures the time required to complete the deletion. This operation tests how efficiently each tree handles the removal of elements.

The program outputs the results in microseconds, offering a detailed comparison of the performance of AVL Trees, Scapegoat Trees, and Red-Black Trees. This detailed timing information helps in understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of each tree type in various scenarios.
