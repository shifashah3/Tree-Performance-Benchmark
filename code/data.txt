Data
structures
serve
as
the
basis
for
abstract
data
types
ADT.
The
ADT
defines
the
logical
form
of
the
data
type.
The
data
structure
implements
the
physical
form
of
the
data
type.
Different
types
of
data
structures
are
suited
to
different
kinds
of
applications,
and
some
are
highly
specialized
to
specific
tasks.
For
example,
relational
databases
commonly
use
B-tree
indexes
for
data
retrieval,
while
compiler
implementations
usually
use
hash
tables
to
look
up
identifiers.
Data
structures
provide
a
means
to
manage
large
amounts
of
data
efficiently
for
uses
such
as
large
databases
and
internet
indexing
services.
Usually,
efficient
data
structures
are
key
to
designing
efficient
algorithms.
Some
formal
design
methods
and
programming
languages
emphasize
data
structures,
rather
than
algorithms,
as
the
key
organizing
factor
in
software
design.
Data
structures
can
be
used
to
organize
the
storage
and
retrieval
of
information
stored
in
both
main
memory
and
secondary
memory.
Implementation
Data
structures
can
be
implemented
using
a
variety
of
programming
languages
and
techniques,
but
they
all
share
the
common
goal
of
efficiently
organizing
and
storing
data.
Data
structures
are
generally
based
on
the
ability
of
a
computer
to
fetch
and
store
data
at
any
place
in
its
memory,
specified
by
a
pointer—a
bit
string,
representing
a
memory
address,
that
can
be
itself
stored
in
memory
and
manipulated
by
the
program.
Thus,
the
array
and
record
data
structures
are
based
on
computing
the
addresses
of
data
items
with
arithmetic
operations,
while
the
linked
data
structures
are
based
on
storing
addresses
of
data
items
within
the
structure
itself.
This
approach
to
data
structuring
has
profound
implications
for
the
efficiency
and
scalability
of
algorithms.
For
instance,
the
contiguous
memory
allocation
in
arrays
facilitates
rapid
access
and
modification
operations,
leading
to
optimized
performance
in
sequential
data
processing
scenarios.
The
implementation
of
a
data
structure
usually
requires
writing
a
set
of
procedures
that
create
and
manipulate
instances
of
that
structure.
The
efficiency
of
a
data
structure
cannot
be
analyzed
separately
from
those
operations.
This
observation
motivates
the
theoretical
concept
of
an
abstract
data
type,
a
data
structure
that
is
defined
indirectly
by
the
operations
that
may
be
performed
on
it,
and
the
mathematical
properties
of
those
operations
including
their
space
and
time
cost
Here are the words separated into different lines:

```
An
array
is
a
number
of
elements
in
a
specific
order,
typically
all
of
the
same
type
(depending
on
the
language,
individual
elements
may
either
all
be
forced
to
be
the
same
type,
or
may
be
of
almost
any
type).
Elements
are
accessed
using
an
integer
index
to
specify
which
element
is
required.
Typical
implementations
allocate
contiguous
memory
words
for
the
elements
of
arrays
(but
this
is
not
always
a
necessity).
Arrays
may
be
fixed-length
or
resizable.
A
linked
list
(also
just
called
list)
is
a
linear
collection
of
data
elements
of
any
type,
called
nodes,
where
each
node
has
itself
a
value,
and
points
to
the
next
node
in
the
linked
list.
The
principal
advantage
of
a
linked
list
over
an
array
is
that
values
can
always
be
efficiently
inserted
and
removed
without
relocating
the
rest
of
the
list.
Certain
other
operations,
such
as
random
access
to
a
certain
element,
are
however
slower
on
lists
than
on
arrays.
A
record
(also
called
tuple
or
struct)
is
an
aggregate
data
structure.
A
record
is
a
value
that
contains
other
values,
typically
in
fixed
number
and
sequence
and
typically
indexed
by
names.
The
elements
of
records
are
usually
called
fields
or
members.
In
the
context
of
object-oriented
programming,
records
are
known
as
plain
old
data
structures
to
distinguish
them
from
objects.[13]
Hash
tables,
also
known
as
hash
maps,
are
data
structures
that
provide
fast
retrieval
of
values
based
on
keys.
They
use
a
hashing
function
to
map
keys
to
indexes
in
an
array,
allowing
for
constant-time
access
in
the
average
case.
Hash
tables
are
commonly
used
in
dictionaries,
caches,
and
database
indexing.
However,
hash
collisions
can
occur,
which
can
impact
their
performance.
Techniques
like
chaining
and
open
addressing
are
employed
to
handle
collisions.
Graphs
are
collections
of
nodes
connected
by
edges,
representing
relationships
between
entities.
Graphs
can
be
used
to
model
social
networks,
computer
networks,
and
transportation
networks,
among
other
things.
They
consist
of
vertices
(nodes)
and
edges
(connections
between
nodes).
Graphs
can
be
directed
or
undirected,
and
they
can
have
cycles
or
be
acyclic.
Graph
traversal
algorithms
include
breadth-first
search
and
depth-first
search.
Stacks
and
queues
are
abstract
data
types
that
can
be
implemented
using
arrays
or
linked
lists.
A
stack
has
two
primary
operations:
push
(adds
an
element
to
the
top
of
the
stack)
and
pop
(removes
the
topmost
element
from
the
stack),
that
follow
the
Last
In,
First
Out
(LIFO)
principle.
Queues
have
two
main
operations:
enqueue
(adds
an
element
to
the
rear
of
the
queue)
and
dequeue
(removes
an
element
from
the
front
of
the
queue)
that
follow
the
First
In,
First
Out
(FIFO)
principle.
Trees
represent
a
hierarchical
organization
of
elements.
A
tree
consists
of
nodes
connected
by
edges,
with
one
node
being
the
root
and
all
other
nodes
forming
subtrees.
Trees
are
widely
used
in
various
algorithms
and
data
storage
scenarios.
Binary
trees
(particularly
heaps),
AVL
trees,
and
B-trees
are
some
popular
types
of
trees.
They
enable
efficient
and
optimal
searching,
sorting,
and
hierarchical
representation
of
data.
A
trie,
also
known
as
a
prefix
tree,
is
a
specialized
tree
data
structure
used
for
the
efficient
retrieval
of
strings.
Tries
store
characters
of
a
string
as
nodes,
with
each
edge
representing
a
character.
They
are
particularly
useful
in
text
processing
scenarios
like
autocomplete,
spell-checking,
and
dictionary
implementations.
Tries
enable
fast
searching
and
prefix-based
operations
on
strings
Linear
algebra
is
central
to
almost
all
areas
of
mathematics.
For
instance,
linear
algebra
is
fundamental
in
modern
presentations
of
geometry,
including
for
defining
basic
objects
such
as
lines,
planes
and
rotations.
Also,
functional
analysis,
a
branch
of
mathematical
analysis,
may
be
viewed
as
the
application
of
linear
algebra
to
function
spaces.
Linear
algebra
is
also
used
in
most
sciences
and
fields
of
engineering,
because
it
allows
modeling
many
natural
phenomena,
and
computing
efficiently
with
such
models.
For
nonlinear
systems,
which
cannot
be
modeled
with
linear
algebra,
it
is
often
used
for
dealing
with
first-order
approximations,
using
the
fact
that
the
differential
of
a
multivariate
function
at
a
point
is
the
linear
map
that
best
approximates
the
function
near
that
point.
The
procedure
(using
counting
rods)
for
solving
simultaneous
linear
equations
now
called
Gaussian
elimination
appears
in
the
ancient
Chinese
mathematical
text
Chapter
Eight:
Rectangular
Arrays
of
The
Nine
Chapters
on
the
Mathematical
Art.
Its
use
is
illustrated
in
eighteen
problems,
with
two
to
five
equations.
[4]
Systems
of
linear
equations
arose
in
Europe
with
the
introduction
in
1637
by
René
Descartes
of
coordinates
in
geometry.
In
fact,
in
this
new
geometry,
now
called
Cartesian
geometry,
lines
and
planes
are
represented
by
linear
equations,
and
computing
their
intersections
amounts
to
solving
systems
of
linear
equations.
The
first
systematic
methods
for
solving
linear
systems
used
determinants
and
were
first
considered
by
Leibniz
in
1693.
In
1750,
Gabriel
Cramer
used
them
for
giving
explicit
solutions
of
linear
systems,
now
called
Cramer's
rule.
Later,
Gauss
further
described
the
method
of
elimination,
which
was
initially
listed
as
an
advancement
in
geodesy.
[5]
In
1844
Hermann
Grassmann
published
his
"Theory
of
Extension"
which
included
foundational
new
topics
of
what
is
today
called
linear
algebra.
In
1848,
James
Joseph
Sylvester
introduced
the
term
matrix,
which
is
Latin
for
womb.
Linear
algebra
grew
with
ideas
noted
in
the
complex
plane.
For
instance,
two
numbers
w
and
z
in
�
{\displaystyle
\mathbb
{C}
}
have
a
difference
w
–
z,
and
the
line
segments
wz
and
0(w
−
z)
are
of
the
same
length
and
direction.
The
segments
are
equipollent.
The
four-dimensional
system
{\displaystyle
\mathbb
{H}
of
quaternions
was
discovered
by
W.R.
Hamilton
in
1843.
The
term
vector
was
introduced
as
v
=
xi
+
yj
+
zk
representing
a
point
in
space.
The
quaternion
difference
also
produces
a
segment
equipollent
to
pq.
Other
hypercomplex
number
systems
also
used
the
idea
of
a
linear
space
with
a
basis.
Arthur
Cayley
introduced
matrix
multiplication
and
the
inverse
matrix
in
1856,
making
possible
the
general
linear
group.
The
mechanism
of
group
representation
became
available
for
describing
complex
and
hypercomplex
numbers.
Crucially,
Cayley
used
a
single
letter
to
denote
a
matrix,
thus
treating
a
matrix
as
an
aggregate
object.
He
also
realized
the
connection
between
matrices
and
determinants,
and
wrote
"There
would
be
many
things
to
say
about
this
theory
of
matrices
which
should,
it
seems
to
me,
precede
the
theory
of
determinants".
Benjamin
Peirce
published
his
Linear
Associative
Algebra
(1872),
and
his
son
Charles
Sanders
Peirce
extended
the
work
later.

The
telegraph
required
an
explanatory
system,
and
the
1873
publication
of
A
Treatise
on
Electricity
and
Magnetism
instituted
a
field
theory
of
forces
and
required
differential
geometry
for
expression.
Linear
algebra
is
flat
differential
geometry
and
serves
in
tangent
spaces
to
manifolds.
Electromagnetic
symmetries
of
spacetime
are
expressed
by
the
Lorentz
transformations,
and
much
of
the
history
of
linear
algebra
is
the
history
of
Lorentz
transformations.
The
first
modern
and
more
precise
definition
of
a
vector
space
was
introduced
by
Peano
in
1888;
by
1900,
a
theory
of
linear
transformations
of
finite-dimensional
vector
spaces
had
emerged.
Linear
algebra
took
its
modern
form
in
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century,
when
many
ideas
and
methods
of
previous
centuries
were
generalized
as
abstract
algebra.
The
development
of
computers
led
to
increased
research
